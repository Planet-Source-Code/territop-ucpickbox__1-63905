As a developer, one of the most mundane tasks I frequently encounter is the wiring-up and managing of the CommonDialog Controls. The ucPickBox has been designed as a lightweight (~80kb), drop in place, API implementation of the CommonDialog Controls which takes much of this hassle away! ucPickBox provides Color, Font, Open (Single / Mutlifile), Save and Print dialog support, while providing a clean GUI to display the results for both 3D and Flat visual styles. In addition, this UserControl exposes 44 Properties, 14 Methods, 13 Events, and 88 Dialog Flags as enumerations which makes it flexible and easy to use. Among the exposed function are handy tools like: ExractPath, ExtractFilename, FileExists, LongToHexColor, QualifyPath, TranslateColor, and TrimPathByLen. The enclosed project provides an extensive test-harness and documentation to explore the many facets of this UserControl. Enjoy!
